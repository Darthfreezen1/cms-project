# Trails in the Sky Wiki/Guide

The goal of this webpage is to create fast access to items, locations and enemies in the game series Trails in the Sky.

Compared to the wiki pages that have already been created, this site is meant to only contain important data related to a players playthrough.

## Features:

Search for entries by name

Ability to sort items and enemies by:
    * alphabetical order
    * location
    * sort enemies by elemental efficiancy
    * sort items by enemy or location

Add/Remove/Edit entries

Request changes to an entry

Create user/moderator/administrative accounts

A typical user will be able to:
    * View entries
    * Search and Sort entries
    * Request changes to an entry
    * Comment on an entry

A moderator has the same access as a typical user but has the ability to:
    * Edit entries
    * Have access to a change requests page

An administrator account will be able to do everything stated above, as well as being able to remove entries.



I would like to eventually include quest walkthroughs at some point.
